what is keylogger?
Keyloggers are a serious threat to users and the users' data, as they track the keystrokes to intercept passwords and other sensitive information typed in through the keyboard. This gives hackers the benefit of access to PIN codes and account numbers, passwords to online shopping sites, email ids, email logins, and other confidential information, etc.When the hackers get access to the users' private and sensitive information, they can take advantage of the extracted data to perform online money transaction the user's account. Keyloggers can sometimes be used as a spying tool to compromise business and state-owned company's data.The main objective of keyloggers is to interfere in the chain of events that happen when a key is pressed and when the data is displayed on the monitor as a result of a keystroke. A keylogger can be done by introducing a wiring or a hardware bug in the keyboard, to achieve video surveillance; terminating input and/or output; or by also implementing the use of a filter driver in the keyboard stack; and demanding data from the user's keyboard using generalized documented methods. There are two other rootkit methods used by hackers: masking in kernel mode and masking in user mode.
